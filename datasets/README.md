In this directory you can find the following three datasets used in the paper:
1. **Cityscapes Extended**: We extended the 33 original Cityscapes labels with 34 traffic sign classes from the GTSDB dataset, into a per dataset compatible combined label set.
2. **GTSDB per pixel (coarse)**: transformed bounding box ground truth into coarse per pixel annotations, i.e. every pixel inside the bounding box is assigned the class of the bounding box.
3. **GTSDB per pixel (fine)**:
